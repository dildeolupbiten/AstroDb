AstroDb is a C/C++ program whose graphical interface is based on static Qt libraries. It is designed to perform similar tasks of what the Python program, [TkAstroDb](https://github.com/dildeolupbiten/TkAstroDb) does, with higher performance respect to TkAstroDb.

Although AstroDb was linked to static Qt libraries, and has no dependancy on any shared Qt libraries, it still has dependencies to some shared libraries related to Qt. These shared libraries are necessarry to run `AstroDb`. You can find them in the `lib` directories which are located in the compressed files created both for both Linux and Windows.

## Usage

Unzip the compressed file then run the executable files found in `AstroDb` folder.

### Astrodatabank

`AstroDb` provides the small sample of Astrodatabank, which gives access to users to study the Analysis feature of AstroDb. However in order to obtain the full version of Astrodatabank, one should contact the webmaster of [Astrodienst](https://www.astro.com), Alois Trendl.

### AstroDb CSV And XML Files

At the end of the analysis process, the results that are related to the selected sheets will be written into `csv` files with which also an xml file named as `config.xml` will be generated. This `xml` file is used for any kind of calculation type defined in the `Calculations` feature of AstroDb. Every calculation type generates its own `config.xml` with the csv files.
